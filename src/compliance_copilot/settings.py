# src/compliance_copilot/settings.py — centralised app configuration.
# Sits under the "api"/"mcp-server" containers in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: every
# module that needs a config value (DB URL today; LLM/embedding/Langfuse
# keys as later features land) imports `settings` from here instead of
# calling `os.getenv(...)` itself. Why centralise: one place to see every
# config key the app reads, one place pydantic validates types/required-ness
# at startup (fail fast on a missing DATABASE_URL, not on the first query),
# and tests can override values without touching real env vars (see
# tests/test_db_integration.py, which reads DATABASE_URL directly to decide
# whether to skip — that's an intentional exception, not a settings bypass).
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # env_file=".env": loads local secrets from the gitignored .env (see
    # .env.example for the template). extra="ignore" so keys this feature
    # doesn't use yet (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, LANGFUSE_*) don't fail validation —
    # they're read by their own future settings fields, not by this one.
